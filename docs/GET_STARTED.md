# Get Started with NodeForge

NodeForge lets you write small Python-like scripts and compile them into Blender Geometry Nodes node groups. The script describes the interface and the node logic; NodeForge builds the actual node group for you.

NodeForge scripts use a DSL, or **domain-specific language**. The language intentionally looks like Python: assignments, function calls, comments, arithmetic, `if`, `for`, lists, imports, and local helper functions use familiar Python syntax. It is not full Python. It only supports the constructs and built-ins that NodeForge knows how to compile into Geometry Nodes.

Use this page as the beginner path. For complete reference material, continue with:

- [DSL Syntax and Semantics](SYNTAX.md) — script syntax, imports, loops, automatic outputs, reusable modules, and unsupported Python features.
- [Core DSL Built-ins Reference](BUILTINS.md) — `input_*`, `output`, math, vectors, fields, geometry primitives, instancing, raw nodes, and runtime loops.
- [Function Library Reference](FUNCTIONS.md) — reusable helpers from the bundled `functions/` catalog.
- [L-systems](LSYSTEMS.md) — L-system scripting and generated procedural systems.

## The basic workflow

Open a Geometry Nodes editor, press `N`, and open the **NodeForge** tab in the sidebar. NodeForge reads source code from a Blender Text datablock. The generated node group stores a copy of its source, so you can load the script back later.


The normal edit cycle is:

1. Create or open a Blender Text datablock.
2. Select that text in the NodeForge **Text Script** field.
3. Write a NodeForge script.
4. Click **Compile Script** to create a new Geometry Nodes group node.
5. Edit the script and click **Update Selected NodeGroup** to replace the selected generated group in place.
6. Click **Load Script From Selected NodeGroup** to copy a generated group’s embedded script back into the selected text block.


The three main buttons are:

| Button | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Compile Script** | Compiles the selected Text datablock into a new Geometry Nodes group and inserts it into the active Geometry Nodes editor when one is open. |
| **Update Selected NodeGroup** | Recompiles the selected Text datablock into the selected generated group node. The group datablock is preserved, so existing node links can stay connected. |
| **Load Script From Selected NodeGroup** | Reads the script stored inside the selected generated group and writes it into the selected text block. If no text block is selected, NodeForge can create/use its scratch text block. |

## First script: one input, one output

Start with the smallest useful node group: one float input and one float output.

```python
value = input_float('Value', default=1.0)
output('Value', value)
```

What this means:

| Line | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `input_float('Value', default=1.0)` | Creates a float input socket named `Value` with default value `1.0`. |
| `value = ...` | Stores that socket value in the script variable `value`. |
| `output('Value', value)` | Creates an output socket named `Value` and connects the value to it. |

After compiling, the generated node group has one input socket and one output socket. This is not visually exciting, but it shows the core model: **inputs create node-group inputs, outputs create node-group outputs**.

## First geometry script: adjustable cube

Now create geometry. This script makes a cube whose size is controlled by a group input.

```python
size = input_float('Size', default=2.0)
geo = cube(size=size)
output('Geometry', geo)
```

The generated group has:

| Socket | Direction | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Size` | Input | Float |
| `Geometry` | Output | Geometry |

The important difference from normal Python is that `geo` is not a mesh object in Python memory. It is a Geometry Nodes value being built by the compiler.

## Use the object's input geometry

NodeForge can also process geometry that already exists on the object using the Geometry input socket. This is the usual Geometry Nodes pattern: the modifier passes the object's current geometry into the node group, the script changes it, and the result is sent back out.

```python
geo = input_geometry('Geometry')
scale = vector(1, 1, 2)
result = transform(geo, scale=scale)
output('Geometry', result)
```

After compiling, connect the object's geometry to the generated group's `Geometry` input if it is not connected automatically. In a Geometry Nodes modifier, this is the socket that carries the mesh or curve from the object in the scene.

Use this when you want to modify an existing object instead of generating all geometry from scratch with functions like `cube(...)`.

## Add variables and transforms

Use variables to keep scripts readable. The following script creates a cube and scales it in Z.

```python
size = input_float('Size', default=1.0)
height = input_float('Height', default=3.0)

base = cube(size=size)
scale = vector(1, 1, height)
geo = transform(base, scale=scale)

output('Geometry', geo)
```

This pattern is usually clearer than nesting calls directly inside other calls. Write each meaningful value once, name it, and pass the name to the next operation.

## Build a small shape with a loop

Lists and compile-time `for` loops are useful for generating repeated geometry. This example creates a row of five cubes.

```python
spacing = input_float('Spacing', default=1.25)
count = 5

parts = []
for i in range(count):
    base = cube(size=1.0)
    offset = vector(i * spacing, 0, 0)
    moved = transform(base, translation=offset)
    parts.append(moved)

geo = join(parts)
output('Geometry', geo)
```

What is happening:

| Part | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `count = 5` | A compile-time value. NodeForge knows it while compiling. |
| `range(count)` | Unrolls the loop during compilation. |
| `parts = []` / `parts.append(...)` | Collects Geometry values into a compile-time list. |
| `join(parts)` | Combines the generated cubes into one Geometry output. |

Use `range(...)` when the number of loop iterations is known during compilation. Use [`repeat_range(...)`](BUILTINS.md#for-i-in-repeat_rangesteps-) when the iteration count must be a runtime input or when you want a Blender Repeat Zone.

## Use the Library panel

The **Library** panel contains three catalogs:

| Catalog | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Local** | Your saved scripts. These are user-owned `.nf` files stored outside the add-on package in Blender’s user data area. |
| **Functions** | Bundled reusable helper functions, such as layout and math helpers. |
| **Examples** | Bundled example node groups and larger demos. |

Each catalog has **Refresh** and **Add Node Group** actions.

1. Open a catalog section, for example **Functions**.
2. Click **Refresh** to scan that catalog.
3. Select an entry from the list.
4. Click **Add Node Group** to insert that entry into the active Geometry Nodes editor.
5. Select the inserted group node and click **Load Script From Selected NodeGroup** if you want to inspect or edit the stored source.

## Save your own script to Local

Use **Local** when you want to keep a script as a reusable file instead of only keeping it as a node group inside the Blender file.

1. Write or load a script in a Text datablock.
2. Open **Library → Local**.
3. Optionally click **New Folder** to organize your scripts.
4. Click **Save to Local**.
5. Choose **Text Block** as the source, enter a script name, choose a folder if needed, and confirm.
6. Click **Refresh** in **Local** to see the saved script.
7. Select it and click **Add Node Group** to insert it into the current Geometry Nodes editor.

You can also save from a selected generated group by choosing **Selected Group** in the **Save to Local** dialog. That uses the source embedded in the node group.

## Reuse a saved script from another script

A saved Local script can be imported and called from another NodeForge script. This is the main reuse mechanism: write a script once, save it as a `.nf` file, then call it from other scripts like a function.

The saved script's `input_*` declarations become function parameters. Its output becomes the value returned by the imported function.

For example, save this as a Local script named `cube_row`:

```python
spacing = input_float('Spacing', default=1.25)
count = 5

parts = []
for i in range(count):
    base = cube(size=1.0)
    offset = vector(i * spacing, 0, 0)
    moved = transform(base, translation=offset)
    parts.append(moved)

geo = join(parts)
output('Geometry', geo)
```

Then use it from another script:

```python
from local import cube_row

spacing = input_float('Spacing', default=2.0)
geo = cube_row(spacing)
output('Geometry', geo)
```

Here `Spacing` from the saved script becomes the `spacing` argument of `cube_row(spacing)`. The saved script's `Geometry` output becomes the returned `geo` value.

## What to read next

Read these in order:

1. [DSL Syntax and Semantics](SYNTAX.md) — learn the language rules and what is not Python.
2. [Core DSL Built-ins Reference](BUILTINS.md) — learn the primitive functions available everywhere.
3. [Function Library Reference](FUNCTIONS.md) — learn the reusable helper catalog.
4. [L-systems](LSYSTEMS.md) — learn the procedural L-system features when you need them.

The fastest way to learn is to load bundled entries from **Library → Examples**, inspect their source with **Load Script From Selected NodeGroup**, and then simplify or modify them in your own Text datablock.
