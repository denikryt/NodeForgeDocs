# Writing L-system scripts

This guide shows how to write L-system scripts in NodeForge.

Use `LSYSTEMS.md` for constructor reference and implementation notes.

## Minimal example

```python
angle = input_float("Angle", default=25.0)
step = input_float("Step", default=0.1)

geo = ls_system(
    ls_axiom("F"),
    ls_rule("F", "F[+F]F[-F]F"),
    ls_iterations(2),
    ls_angle(angle),
    ls_step(step),
)

output("Geometry", geo)
```

What happens:

1. Start with the axiom string: `F`.
2. Apply rewrite rules `ls_iterations(...)` times.
3. Read the final string as turtle commands.
4. Generate geometry from drawn `F` segments.

## Basic parts

```python
ls_axiom("F")
```

The starting string. There is exactly one axiom per `ls_system(...)`.

If the axiom contains `F`, the system starts with drawable geometry. For example, `ls_axiom("F")` with zero iterations already draws one segment.

If the axiom contains only grammar symbols such as `X`, `A`, or `B`, it does not draw anything by itself. Those symbols must be rewritten into `F` or other turtle commands before geometry appears.

```python
ls_rule("F", "F[+F]F[-F]F")
```

A rewrite rule. Every `F` becomes `F[+F]F[-F]F` during each iteration.

```python
ls_iterations(2)
```

How many rewrite passes to run. This is compile-time.

```python
ls_angle(angle)
```

Turn angle in degrees. `+` and `-` use this value.

```python
ls_step(step)
```

Forward distance for `F` and `f`.

## Symbols

| Symbol | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `F` | Move forward and draw a segment. |
| `f` | Move forward without drawing. |
| `+` | Turn left by `ls_angle(...)`. |
| `-` | Turn right by `ls_angle(...)`. |
| `[` | Save current position and direction. Start a branch. |
| `]` | Restore saved position and direction. End a branch. |

Other ASCII letters, digits, and `_` can be grammar symbols. They help control rewriting but do not draw anything if they remain in the final string.

Example:

```python
geo = ls_system(
    ls_axiom("X"),
    ls_rule("X", "F+X"),
    ls_iterations(3),
    ls_angle(60),
    ls_step(0.1),
)
```

`X` keeps the rewrite going. The drawn geometry comes from `F`.

## How branches work

This rule creates two side branches:

```python
ls_rule("F", "F[+F]F[-F]F")
```

Read it as:

```text
F     draw forward
[+F]  save state, turn left, draw branch, restore state
F     continue from the original trunk
[-F]  save state, turn right, draw branch, restore state
F     continue from the original trunk
```

`[` and `]` are important because they stop a side branch from moving the main trunk position.

## Runtime controls

These values can be runtime inputs:

```python
angle = input_float("Angle", default=24.0)
step = input_float("Step", default=0.06)
```

Use them in the system:

```python
ls_angle(angle)
ls_step(step)
```

Changing `angle` changes branch direction. Changing `step` changes segment length.

The following are not runtime controls in the current implementation:

```text
axiom
rules
iteration count
branch topology
```

Changing those means the L-system must be rebuilt.


## Parameterized commands and marker points


Rule strings may be assembled from compile-time string fragments before L-system validation runs:

```python
branch = "[+F]F[-F]"
rule = f"F{branch}F"

geo = ls_system(
    ls_axiom("F"),
    ls_rule("F", rule),
    ls_iterations(2),
    ls_angle(25),
    ls_step(0.1),
)
```

F-string interpolation is string-only. Interpolating runtime values, numeric constants, L-system parts, conversion flags, or format specs raises `CompileError`.

Use `ls_param(...)` when one system needs multiple lengths or angles. Inside L-system strings, module arguments are either numeric literals or names declared with `ls_param(...)`; they are not Python expressions.

```python
main_angle = input_float("Main Angle", default=24)
side_angle = input_float("Side Angle", default=35)
branch_len = input_float("Branch Length", default=0.06)
leaf_size = input_float("Leaf Size", default=0.8)

plant = ls_system(
    ls_axiom("X"),
    ls_rule("X", "F(branch_len)[+(main_angle)XLeaf(leaf_size)][-(side_angle)XBud]FX"),
    ls_rule("F", "F(branch_len)F(branch_len)"),
    ls_iterations(4),
    ls_angle(25),
    ls_step(0.1),
    ls_param("main_angle", main_angle),
    ls_param("side_angle", side_angle),
    ls_param("branch_len", branch_len),
    ls_param("leaf_size", leaf_size),
    ls_marker("Leaf", "size"),
    ls_marker("Bud"),
)

leaf_points = ls_points(plant, marker="Leaf")
bud_points = ls_points(plant, marker="Bud")
```

`Leaf(size)` and `Bud` are marker modules because they are declared with `ls_marker(...)`. They emit point data at the current turtle position. They do not create leaf or bud geometry by themselves; use the extracted points with tools such as `instance_on_points(...)`. Compact syntax is intentional: whitespace is invalid in L-system strings and is not used to distinguish modules.

## Transforming and joining L-systems

An L-system result is normal geometry.

```python
plant_a = ls_system(
    ls_axiom("F"),
    ls_rule("F", "F[+F]F[-F]F"),
    ls_iterations(2),
    ls_angle(25),
    ls_step(0.1),
)

plant_b = ls_system(
    ls_axiom("F"),
    ls_rule("F", "F[+F]F[-F]F"),
    ls_iterations(4),
    ls_angle(25),
    ls_step(0.07),
)

plant_b = transform(plant_b, translation=vector(1, 0, 0))
geo = join(plant_a, plant_b)

output("Geometry", geo)
```

Use `translation`, not `position`, in `transform(...)`.

## Common patterns

### Koch-style curve

```python
geo = ls_system(
    ls_axiom("F"),
    ls_rule("F", "F+F--F+F"),
    ls_iterations(3),
    ls_angle(60),
    ls_step(0.1),
)
output("Geometry", geo)
```

### Branching plant

```python
angle = input_float("Angle", default=25.0)
step = input_float("Step", default=0.12)

geo = ls_system(
    ls_axiom("F"),
    ls_rule("F", "F[+F]F[-F]F"),
    ls_iterations(3),
    ls_angle(angle),
    ls_step(step),
)
output("Geometry", geo)
```


### Classic fractal plant

This is a common L-system plant pattern. `X` controls growth and does not draw; `F` draws the visible segments.

```python
angle = input_float("Angle", default=25.0)
step = input_float("Step", default=0.04)

geo = ls_system(
    ls_axiom("X"),
    ls_rule("X", "F+[[X]-X]-F[-FX]+X"),
    ls_rule("F", "FF"),
    ls_iterations(5),
    ls_angle(angle),
    ls_step(step),
)

geo = transform(geo, rotation=vector(0, 0, radians(90)))
output("Geometry", geo)
```

### Grammar symbol for growth

```python
geo = ls_system(
    ls_axiom("X"),
    ls_rule("X", "F[+X][-X]FX"),
    ls_rule("F", "FF"),
    ls_iterations(4),
    ls_angle(24),
    ls_step(0.06),
)
output("Geometry", geo)
```

`X` does not draw. It controls where future growth happens.

## Errors to avoid

Do not use unsupported characters in rules:

```python
ls_rule("F", "F → F+F")  # bad: Unicode arrow
```

Do not leave branches unmatched:

```python
ls_rule("F", "F[+F")  # bad: missing ]
```

Do not expect `f` to draw:

```python
ls_rule("F", "FfF")  # middle move creates a gap
```

Do not use `position=` in `transform(...)`:

```python
geo = transform(geo, position=vector(1, 0, 0))  # bad
geo = transform(geo, translation=vector(1, 0, 0))  # good
```
